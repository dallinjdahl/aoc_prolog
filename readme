Advent of Code: Prolog
https://adventofcode.com/2021

This is a repository containing my solutions to the 2021 advent of code
in prolog.  There are 2 input files, input and small.  Small references
the example input, and input is the actual problem input.  The prolog
code assumes the input to be redirected to stdin.  Currently this
is done within the prolog environment with
	see(input).
or
	see(small).
To restart the input, you can run:
	seen, see(input).
